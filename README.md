Team Treehouse Project 11 Fright Machine

With this unit I learned about Design Patterns.  In this particular project, I used the Observer design pattern to make the Fright Machine more exstensible.  I also used the Adapter pattern to make the Camera act like the other Accessories that interact with the Fright Machine.
